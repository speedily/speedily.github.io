Cancellation & Refund Policy
Last updated on 30-01-2026 00:56:40
HAVOC SOFTWARE believes in helping its customers as far as possible, and has therefore a liberal
cancellation policy. Under this policy:
• Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made immediately after placing the order.
However, the cancellation request may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to the
vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of shipping them.
• HAVOC SOFTWARE does not accept cancellation requests for digital services like design and digital items like websites, apps, software items and perishable items like flowers, eatables, 
etc. However, refund/replacement can be made if the customer establishes that the quality of product
delivered is not good.
• In case of receipt of damaged or defective items please report the same to our Customer Service team.
The request will, however, be entertained once the merchant has checked and determined the same at his
own end. This should be reported within Only same day days of receipt of the products. In case you feel
that the product received is not as shown on the site or as per your expectations, you must bring it to the
notice of our customer service within Only same day days of receiving the product. The Customer
Service Team after looking into your complaint will take an appropriate decision.
• In case of complaints regarding products that come with a warranty from manufacturers, please refer
the issue to them. In case of any Refunds approved by the HAVOC SOFTWARE, it’ll take 16-30 Days
days for the refund to be processed to the end customer.
